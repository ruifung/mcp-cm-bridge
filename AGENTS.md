# Agent State

The `agent-state/` directory contains transient working documents created during agentic development sessions. It is gitignored.

## Conventions

- **Naming:** `agent-state/<agent-name>-<slug>.md` (e.g., `agent-state/gopher-test-results.md`)
- **Lifecycle:** Files are transient and may be cleaned up between sessions.
- **Purpose:** Cross-agent handoffs, investigation notes, and intermediate analysis. Not a substitute for proper documentation.
